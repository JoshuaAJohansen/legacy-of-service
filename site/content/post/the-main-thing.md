For many of you it should be your Battle Board. Your 8 week plan for the quarantine. It will amaze you what you can get done with an 8 week plan. Years worth of progress tackled in week.

 What projects you are going to work on, what habits you are going to start building. What routines are you going to set up? Who are you going to facetime? How often are you going to facetime people?
