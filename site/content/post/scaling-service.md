description: Why make a blog? What even is a blog?
---
I heard Scott Hanselman and Kent Dodds talking about blogs. Scott explained that blogs are useful because you can write a post and anyone thereafter will be able to hear your story and go on their way.

The inspiration for this was some friends of mine have been having trouble coping with the Distant socialization during the COVID-19 quarantine so here are some things to help you thrive indoors.

Eating 2-3 meals a day. Working out in the morning. Sleeping regularly for however long you need to feel optimal. Factor in how many hours a day you waste because you aren't fully present, and push that time into your sleep and stay on the path.

Thomas Clear lays it out in his book ( insert image of tree of good decisions for your day). It only takes a few things to get 80% of the way there. Know what you need, schedule it, alarm it, time it, and do it. Just decide. If you are really in a rut you can start by stopping the things you know are wrong. The positive cycle will spin upward as you gain momentum. At this point it is an uphill battle so we need to start getting momentum and giving each other a push when we can.
