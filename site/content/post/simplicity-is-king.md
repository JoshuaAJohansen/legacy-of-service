# Simple.

During the weeks leading up to the COVID-19 quarantine in San Francisco I set out to remove what is not essential from my house. The cleansing of old household things has been an on going process that has been ramping up in intensity. The feedback loop of getting rid of things that do not bring positive energy, emotions, or utility to my life has lead to an increased density every where I look. Each corner, and each shelf packed full of delightful things. Thngs that bring me joy. Things that help further my life in meaningful ways that I value. Less things that are nice. More things that vibrate your soul upon their touch, shimmer, or smell.

> Simplicity is king.

With less things, more space, more clarity, and more time I am starting my blog. I have done this several times before. This time is different. I'm using a cms to post new posts without tinkering with code, packages, or other unnecessary steps. 

I'm keeping it simple.
